Goal - share data between components
  1. ~~Lightweight~~ - everything is compile time. The only question is -
     storing acessor functions - should be possible to store them in ROM.
  2. ~~Lock Policy support~~ - can be solved with the context passing
  3. No generator should be required - not a problem - it's not required as
  is.
  4. PODs should be supported (not only fundamentals).
  5. ~~Specify who owns the data~~ - not needed, because we can solve
     this by using read / write accessor functions
  6. All data must be initialized prior to registry declaration

Rationale
Why does this thing need to exist?
  1. It's possible to share only bits of data between components, but not
  ENTIRE components.
  2. It's a possible replacement for RTE but for opensource.
